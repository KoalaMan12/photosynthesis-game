Photosynthesis is the process of plants making food for themselves by first absorbing light energy from the sun using chlorophyll inside the leaf which is the key part that starts photosynthesis and then there is the process of taking in materials for energy and releasing materials as a product of the system. After plants absorb energy from the sunlight, it then uses the light energy and mixes it with the water that the plant has taken from the roots, and up through the xylem, the plant then takes the water from the xylem into the phloem were the ingredients of photosynthesis can photosynthesize. One more step is required for a plant to fully photosynthesize. Plants need to mix in water, light, and carbon dioxide to get the glucose that the plant makes as food to survive. And for the plant to get carbon dioxide, the plants stomata open and close to take in the carbon dioxide and finally combine the 3 ingredients and photosynthesize. Once plants are done photosynthesizing, a product of this system is the oxygen we breath, and the glucose that the plant has produced through photosynthesis.

 The chemical equation for photosynthesis is 6CO2 + 6H2O --> C6H12O6 + 6 O2
   The chemical equation represents the process and products of photosynthesis
